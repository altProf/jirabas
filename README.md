# jirabas

Are you a console man?
Than don't spend your time by searching and clicking Jira just to find which ticket number you resolved!

## Installation

    gem install jirabas

## Usage

    jirabas

Will show actual information for you:
-   Tickets in progress;
-   Resolved tickets for past 2 days;
-   Your tickets TODO.

When you run it first time, it will ask your jira credentials and saves it in ~/.jirabas

## Our TODO plans:
-   Add pre-commit-message feature which allows to populate your git pre commit message template with tickets information.

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
